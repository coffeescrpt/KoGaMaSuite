# KoGaMaSuite
> A formerly private suite of tools, originally developed for exclusive use by the ``DVRKZ`` inner circle. <br>
> Majority of the scripts visible come from either late 2023 or mid 2024. <br>
> All of the tools have been developed by [Coffescrpt (Simon)](https://github.com/coffeescrpt/)

> [!TIP]
> **DVRKZ** is a private group of friends that aims to find and exploit silly vulnerabilities. <br>
> We also strive to have fun and cause some chaos before anything else. <br>
> We stand proud for [Exposals of 16th March](https://mega.nz/file/cVx0RAYB#mZfNVVro_Vtu2qBIf07KBdNfKLXCzsO_jLNfnEX-o8Q).

> [!NOTE]
> List of available tools: <br>
> [Reverse](https://github.com/coffeescrpt/Aphrodite/tree/main/Tools/ScriptReverse) - Python tool that attempts to deobfuscate `.js` scripts and tries to automatically look for suspicious patterns from an array. <br>
> [Preset Text](https://github.com/coffeescrpt/Aphrodite/tree/main/Tools/TextHotkey) - Python tool that allows you to create presets (hotkey : text) that on click will set / write out the text. Works with WebGL-frames. <br>
> [MassComment](https://github.com/coffeescrpt/Aphrodite/tree/main/Tools/MassComment) - Python tool that allows to spread comments under multiple defined games as well as preset comment content per account. <br>
> [MassDescription](https://github.com/coffeescrpt/Aphrodite/tree/main/Tools/MassDescription) - Python tool that allows you to change description of many accounts at once. <br>
> [MassInvite](https://github.com/coffeescrpt/Aphrodite/tree/main/Tools/TargetInvite) - Python tool that allows you to spam invite specified profile / user. <br>
> [ExportDM](https://github.com/coffeescrpt/Aphrodite/tree/main/Tools/ExportDMs) - A tampermonkey script that allows you to export & download direct messages. <br>
> [ScrambleProjects](https://github.com/coffeescrpt/Aphrodite/tree/main/Tools/Projectscramble) - A tampermonkey script that helps to overtake and scramble information used for recovery. Renames owned projects, leaves those we are a member of as well as kicks people that are members of our projects. <br>
> [TLIS](https://github.com/coffeescrpt/Aphrodite/tree/main/Tools/TLIS) - A tampermonkey malware sample meant to steal and log accounts. Somewhat advanced sample in comparison to other known stealers. <br>
> <br> *There's a possibility I will post more tools although I am not fully certain yet.*

> [!WARNING]
> I do **not** take any responsibility for any bans or usage consequences of provided tools. <br>
> I have put these out for display to show how many ways there are to fool around with this silly company. <br>
> Use it at your own risk, you're the one to pick whether it is worth it.
