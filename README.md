# Aphrodite
> A formerly private suite of tools, originally developed for exclusive use by the ``DVRKZ`` inner circle. <br>
> Majority of the scripts visible come from either late 2023 or mid 2024. <br>
> All of the tools have been developed by [Coffescrpt (Simon)](https://github.com/coffeescrpt/)

> [!TIP]
> **DVRKZ** is a private group of friends that aims to find and exploit silly vulnerabilities. <br>
> We also strive to have fun and cause some chaos before anything else. <br>
> We stand proud for [Exposals of 16th March](https://mega.nz/file/cVx0RAYB#mZfNVVro_Vtu2qBIf07KBdNfKLXCzsO_jLNfnEX-o8Q).

> [!NOTE]
> List of available tools: <br>
> [Reverse](https://github.com/coffeescrpt/Aphrodite/tree/main/Tools/ScriptReverse) - Python tool that attempts to deobfuscate `.js` scripts and tries to automatically look for suspicious patterns from an array. <br>

> [!WARNING]
> I do **not** take any responsibility for any bans or consequences resulting from usage of provided tools. <br>
> I have put these out for display to show how many ways there are to fool around with this silly company. <br>
> Use it at your own risk, you're the one to pick whether it is worth it.
